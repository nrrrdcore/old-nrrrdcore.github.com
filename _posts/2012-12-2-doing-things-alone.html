title: On Doing Things Alone
summary: I've changed a lot in thirteen years, but I'm glad I've never forgotten how to be alone...

<p>When I was eleven I asked my mom if I could go see a movie by myself. "Do you wanna take any friends?" No. "Really? Well, Ok."</p>

<p>She didn't call me 'weird' and she didn't expect that I was going to sneak off and do something an eleven year old wasn't supposed to. She knew what it was like to enjoy her own company and what it felt like to make peace with being alone.</p>

<p>Thirteen years later, a Portland cab driver asks "Are you here for work?" No. "Vacation?" Kind of. "Do you know a lot of people here? You must have friends here." No. "Really?"</p>
